How I have my dotfiles set up (IN PROGRESS).

This should explain a lot:

$ export GIT_DIR=.dotfiles_git-dir
$ export GIT_WORK_TREE=~
$ git status

And .dotfiles_git-dir/info/exclude is in the work tree, to serve as a
".gitignore" for the repo, but only affecting my dotfiles and not every
invocation of git (since ~/.gitignore is one of the default places that git
looks for ignore patterns).

.dotfiles_git-dir/my/ is where I put things that are purely related to the
maintenance of my dotfiles in a repository.

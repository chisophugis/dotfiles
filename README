How I have my dotfiles set up (IN PROGRESS).

The setup is self-referential. This should explain a lot:

$ export GIT_DIR=~/.dotfiles_git-dir
$ export GIT_WORK_TREE=~
$ cd
$ git status

(`source .dotfiles_git-dir/my/git_env-defs` makes this easier)

And .dotfiles_git-dir/info/exclude is in the work tree, to serve as a
".gitignore" for the repo, but only affecting my dotfiles and not every
invocation of git (since ~/.gitignore is one of the default places that git
looks for ignore patterns).

.dotfiles_git-dir/my/ is where I put things that are purely related to the
maintenance of my dotfiles in a repository.

To do the initial setup:

$ cd
$ git clone --bare https://github.com/chisophugis/dotfiles.git .dotfiles_git-dir
$ # Could just source .dotfiles_git-dir/my/git_enf-defs instead of passing
$ # `--git-dir` and `--work-tree` in this next command.
$ git --git-dir=.dotfiles_git-dir --work-tree=. checkout -f

`-f` is needed because .git/info/exclude is being checked out from the repo
*into* the git-dir itself (and so is already present, and git complains).
Alternatively, you could pass `--template=''` to the git-clone to avoid
creating the skeleton files in the git-dir.


After checking things out, you will want to install zsh, vim, and git and
edit /etc/passwd to use /usr/bin/zsh instead of /bin/bash for your user.
